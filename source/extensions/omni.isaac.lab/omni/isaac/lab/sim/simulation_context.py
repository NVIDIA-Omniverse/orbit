class SimulationContext(_SimulationContext):
    """A class to control simulation-related events such as physics stepping and rendering.

    The simulation context helps control various simulation aspects. This includes:

    * configure the simulator with different settings such as the physics time-step, the number of physics substeps,
      and the physics solver parameters (for more information, see :class:`omni.isaac.lab.sim.SimulationCfg`)
    * playing, pausing, stepping and stopping the simulation
    * adding and removing callbacks to different simulation events such as physics stepping, rendering, etc.

    This class inherits from the :class:`omni.isaac.core.simulation_context.SimulationContext` class and
    adds additional functionalities such as setting up the simulation context with a configuration object,
    exposing other commonly used simulator-related functions, and performing version checks of Isaac Sim
    to ensure compatibility between releases.

    The simulation context is a singleton object. This means that there can only be one instance
    of the simulation context at any given time. This is enforced by the parent class. Therefore, it is
    not possible to create multiple instances of the simulation context. Instead, the simulation context
    can be accessed using the ``instance()`` method.

    .. attention::
        Since we only support the `PyTorch <https://pytorch.org/>`_ backend for simulation, the
        simulation context is configured to use the ``torch`` backend by default. This means that
        all the data structures used in the simulation are ``torch.Tensor`` objects.

    The simulation context can be used in two different modes of operations:

    1. **Standalone python script**: In this mode, the user has full control over the simulation and
       can trigger stepping events synchronously (i.e. as a blocking call). In this case the user
       has to manually call :meth:`step` step the physics simulation and :meth:`render` to
       render the scene.
    2. **Omniverse extension**: In this mode, the user has limited control over the simulation stepping
       and all the simulation events are triggered asynchronously (i.e. as a non-blocking call). In this
       case, the user can only trigger the simulation to start, pause, and stop. The simulation takes
       care of stepping the physics simulation and rendering the scene.

    Based on above, for most functions in this class there is an equivalent function that is suffixed
    with ``_async``. The ``_async`` functions are used in the Omniverse extension mode and
    the non-``_async`` functions are used in the standalone python script mode.
    """

    class RenderMode(enum.IntEnum):
        """Different rendering modes for the simulation.

        Render modes correspond to how the viewport and other UI elements (such as listeners to keyboard or mouse
        events) are updated. There are three main components that can be updated when the simulation is rendered:

        1. **UI elements and other extensions**: These are UI elements (such as buttons, sliders, etc.) and other
           extensions that are running in the background that need to be updated when the simulation is running.
        2. **Cameras**: These are typically based on Hydra textures and are used to render the scene from different
           viewpoints. They can be attached to a viewport or be used independently to render the scene.
        3. **Viewports**: These are windows where you can see the rendered scene.

        Updating each of the above components has a different overhead. For example, updating the viewports is
        computationally expensive compared to updating the UI elements. Therefore, it is useful to be able to
        control what is updated when the simulation is rendered. This is where the render mode comes in. There are
        four different render modes:

        * :attr:`NO_GUI_OR_RENDERING`: The simulation is running without a GUI and off-screen rendering flag is disabled,
          so none of the above are updated.
        * :attr:`NO_RENDERING`: No rendering, where only 1 is updated at a lower rate.
        * :attr:`PARTIAL_RENDERING`: Partial rendering, where only 1 and 2 are updated.
        * :attr:`FULL_RENDERING`: Full rendering, where everything (1, 2, 3) is updated.

    This function facilitates the creation of a simulation context and provides flexibility in configuring various

    overwritten based on arguments to the function.

        gravity_enabled: Whether to enable gravity in the simulation. Defaults to True.
        device: Device to run the simulation on. Defaults to "cuda:0".
        dt: Time step for the simulation: Defaults to 0.01.
        sim_cfg: :class:`omni.isaac.lab.sim.SimulationCfg` to use for the simulation. Defaults to None.

        add_lighting: Whether to add a dome light to the simulation. Defaults to False.
        auto_add_lighting: Whether to automatically add a dome light to the simulation if the simulation has a GUI.
            Defaults to False. This is useful for debugging tests in the GUI.
