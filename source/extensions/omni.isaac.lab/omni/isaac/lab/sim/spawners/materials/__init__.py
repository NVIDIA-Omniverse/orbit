"""Sub-module for spawners that spawn USD-based and PhysX-based materials.

`Materials`_ are used to define the appearance and physical properties of objects in the simulation.
In Omniverse, they are defined using NVIDIA's `Material Definition Language (MDL)`_. MDL is based on
the physically-based rendering (PBR) model, which is a set of equations that describe how light
interacts with a surface. The PBR model is used to create realistic-looking materials.

While MDL is primarily used for defining the appearance of objects, it can be extended to define
the physical properties of objects. For example, the friction and restitution coefficients of a
rubber material. A `physics material`_ can be assigned to a physics object to
define its physical properties.  There are different kinds of physics materials, such as rigid body
material, deformable material, and fluid material.

In order to apply a material to an object, we "bind" the geometry of the object to the material.
For this, we use the `USD Material Binding API`_. The material binding API takes in the path to
the geometry and the path to the material, and binds them together.

For physics material, the material is bound to the physics object with the 'physics' purpose.
When parsing physics material properties on an object, the following priority is used:

1. Material binding with a 'physics' purpose (physics material)
2. Material binding with no purpose (visual material)
3. Material binding with a 'physics' purpose on the `Physics Scene`_ prim.
4. Default values of material properties inside PhysX.

Usage:
    .. code-block:: python

        import omni.isaac.core.utils.prims as prim_utils

        import omni.isaac.lab.sim as sim_utils

        # create a visual material
        visual_material_cfg = sim_utils.GlassMdlCfg(glass_ior=1.0, thin_walled=True)
        visual_material_cfg.func("/World/Looks/glassMaterial", visual_material_cfg)

        # create a mesh prim
        cube_cfg = sim_utils.CubeCfg(size=[1.0, 1.0, 1.0])
        cube_cfg.func("/World/Primitives/Cube", cube_cfg)

        # bind the cube to the visual material
        sim_utils.bind_visual_material("/World/Primitives/Cube", "/World/Looks/glassMaterial")
