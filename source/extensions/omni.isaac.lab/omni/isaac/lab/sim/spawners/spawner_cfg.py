    """Configuration parameters for spawning an asset.

    Spawning an asset is done by calling the :attr:`func` function. The function takes in the
    prim path to spawn the asset at, the configuration instance and transformation, and returns the
    prim path of the spawned asset.

    The function is typically decorated with :func:`omni.isaac.lab.sim.spawner.utils.clone` decorator
    that checks if input prim path is a regex expression and spawns the asset at all matching prims.
    For this, the decorator uses the Cloner API from Isaac Sim and handles the :attr:`copy_from_source`
    parameter.

    The semantic tags follow the `Replicator Semantic` tagging system. Each tag is a tuple of the
    form ``(type, data)``, where ``type`` is the type of the tag and ``data`` is the semantic label
    associated with the tag. For example, to annotate a spawned asset in the class avocado, the semantic
    tag would be ``[("class", "avocado")]``.

    You can specify multiple semantic tags by passing in a list of tags. For example, to annotate a
    spawned asset in the class avocado and the color green, the semantic tags would be
    ``[("class", "avocado"), ("color", "green")]``.
