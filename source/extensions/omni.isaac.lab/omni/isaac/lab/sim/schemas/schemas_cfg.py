class DeformableBodyPropertiesCfg:

    A deformable body is a body that can deform under forces. The configuration allows users to specify
    the properties of the deformable body, such as the solver iteration counts, damping, and self-collision.

    An FEM-based deformable body is created by providing a collision mesh and simulation mesh. The collision mesh
    is used for collision detection and the simulation mesh is used for simulation. The collision mesh is usually
    a simplified version of the simulation mesh.

    Based on the above, the PhysX team provides APIs to either set the simulation and collision mesh directly
    (by specifying the points) or to simplify the collision mesh based on the simulation mesh. The simplification
    process involves remeshing the collision mesh and simplifying it based on the target triangle count.

    Since specifying the collision mesh points directly is not a common use case, we only expose the parameters
    to simplify the collision mesh based on the simulation mesh. If you want to provide the collision mesh points,
    please open an issue on the repository and we can add support for it.
