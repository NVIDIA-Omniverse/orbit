    To make the asset instanceable, we must follow a certain structure dictated by how USD scene-graph
    instancing and physics work. The rigid body component must be added to each instance and not the
    referenced asset (i.e. the prototype prim itself). This is because the rigid body component defines
    properties that are specific to each instance and cannot be shared under the referenced asset. For
    more information, please check the `documentation <https://docs.omniverse.nvidia.com/extensions/latest/ext_physics/rigid-bodies.html#instancing-rigid-bodies>`_.

    Due to the above, we follow the following structure:

    * ``{prim_path}`` - The root prim that is an Xform with the rigid body and mass APIs if configured.
    * ``{prim_path}/geometry`` - The prim that contains the mesh and optionally the materials if configured.
