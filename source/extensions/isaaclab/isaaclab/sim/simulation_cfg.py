    These parameters are used to configure the PhysX solver. For more information, see the `PhysX 5 SDK
    documentation`_.

    PhysX 5 supports GPU-accelerated physics simulation. This is enabled by default, but can be disabled
    through the flag `use_gpu`. Unlike CPU PhysX, the GPU simulation feature is not able to dynamically
    grow all the buffers. Therefore, it is necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of the buffer sizes
    for GPU features. If insufficient buffer sizes are provided, the simulation will fail with errors and
    lead to adverse behaviors. The buffer sizes can be adjusted through the `gpu_*` parameters.
