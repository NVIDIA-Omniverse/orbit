class VisualizationMarkers:
    """A class to coordinate groups of visual markers (loaded from USD).

    This class allows visualization of different UI markers in the scene, such as points and frames.
    The class wraps around the `UsdGeom.PointInstancer`_ for efficient handling of objects
    in the stage via instancing the created marker prototype prims.

    A marker prototype prim is a reusable template prim used for defining variations of objects
    in the scene. For example, a sphere prim can be used as a marker prototype prim to create
    multiple sphere prims in the scene at different locations. Thus, prototype prims are useful
    for creating multiple instances of the same prim in the scene.

    The class parses the configuration to create different the marker prototypes into the stage. Each marker
    prototype prim is created as a child of the :class:`UsdGeom.PointInstancer` prim. The prim path for the
    the marker prim is resolved using the key of the marker in the :attr:`VisualizationMarkersCfg.markers`
    dictionary. The marker prototypes are created using the :meth:`omni.isaac.core.utils.create_prim`
    function, and then then instanced using :class:`UsdGeom.PointInstancer` prim to allow creating multiple
    instances of the marker prims.

    Switching between different marker prototypes is possible by calling the :meth:`visualize` method with
    the prototype indices corresponding to the marker prototype. The prototype indices are based on the order
    in the :attr:`VisualizationMarkersCfg.markers` dictionary. For example, if the dictionary has two markers,
    "marker1" and "marker2", then their prototype indices are 0 and 1 respectively. The prototype indices
    can be passed as a list or array of integers.

    Usage:
        The following snippet shows how to create 24 sphere markers with a radius of 1.0 at random translations
        within the range [-1.0, 1.0]. The first 12 markers will be colored red and the rest will be colored green.

        .. note::
            If the prim `PointInstancer` is hidden in the stage, the function will simply return
            without updating the markers. This helps in unnecessary computation when the markers
            are not visible.

        Whenever updating the markers, the input arrays must have the same number of elements
        in the first dimension. If the number of elements is different, the `UsdGeom.PointInstancer`
        will raise an error complaining about the mismatch.

        Additionally, the function supports dynamic update of the markers. This means that the
        number of markers can change between calls. For example, if you have 24 points that you
        want to visualize, you can pass 24 translations, orientations, and scales. If you want to
        visualize only 12 points, you can pass 12 translations, orientations, and scales. The
        function will automatically update the number of markers in the scene.

        The function will also update the marker prototypes based on their prototype indices. For instance,
        if you have two marker prototypes, and you pass the following marker indices: [0, 1, 0, 1], the function
        will update the first and third markers with the first prototype, and the second and fourth markers
        with the second prototype. This is useful when you want to visualize different markers in the same
        scene. The list of marker indices must have the same number of elements as the translations, orientations,
        or scales. If the number of elements is different, the function will raise an error.

        .. caution::
            This function will update all the markers instanced from the prototypes. That means
            if you have 24 markers, you will need to pass 24 translations, orientations, and scales.

            If you want to update only a subset of the markers, you will need to handle the indices
            yourself and pass the complete arrays to this function.

        Args:
            translations: Translations w.r.t. parent prim frame. Shape is (M, 3).
                Defaults to None, which means left unchanged.
            orientations: Quaternion orientations (w, x, y, z) w.r.t. parent prim frame. Shape is (M, 4).
                Defaults to None, which means left unchanged.
            scales: Scale applied before any rotation is applied. Shape is (M, 3).
                Defaults to None, which means left unchanged.
            marker_indices: Decides which marker prototype to visualize. Shape is (M).
