class NonHolonomicAction(ActionTerm):
    r"""Non-holonomic action that maps a two dimensional action to the velocity of the robot in
    the x, y and yaw directions.

    This action term helps model a skid-steer robot base. The action is a 2D vector which comprises of the
    forward velocity :math:`v_{B,x}` and the turning rate :\omega_{B,z}: in the base frame. Using the current
    base orientation, the commands are transformed into dummy joint velocity targets as:

    .. math::

        \dot{q}_{0, des} &= v_{B,x} \cos(\theta) \\
        \dot{q}_{1, des} &= v_{B,x} \sin(\theta) \\
        \dot{q}_{2, des} &= \omega_{B,z}

    where :math:`\theta` is the yaw of the 2-D base. Since the base is simulated as a dummy joint, the yaw is directly
    the value of the revolute joint along z, i.e., :math:`q_2 = \theta`.

    .. note::
        The current implementation assumes that the base is simulated with three dummy joints (prismatic joints along x
        and y, and revolute joint along z). This is because it is easier to consider the mobile base as a floating link
        controlled by three dummy joints, in comparison to simulating wheels which is at times is tricky because of
        friction settings.

        However, the action term can be extended to support other base configurations as well.

    .. tip::
        For velocity control of the base with dummy mechanism, we recommend setting high damping gains to the joints.
        This ensures that the base remains unperturbed from external disturbances, such as an arm mounted on the base.
