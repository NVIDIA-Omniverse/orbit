class EventManager(ManagerBase):
    """Manager for orchestrating operations based on different simulation events.

    The event manager applies operations to the environment based on different simulation events. For example,
    changing the masses of objects or their friction coefficients during initialization/ reset, or applying random
    pushes to the robot at a fixed interval of steps. The user can specify several modes of events to fine-tune the
    behavior based on when to apply the event.

    The event terms are parsed from a config class containing the manager's settings and each term's
    parameters. Each event term should instantiate the :class:`EventTermCfg` class.

    Event terms can be grouped by their mode. The mode is a user-defined string that specifies when
    the event term should be applied. This provides the user complete control over when event
    terms should be applied.

    For a typical training process, you may want to apply events in the following modes:

    - "startup": Event is applied once at the beginning of the training.
    - "reset": Event is applied at every reset.
    - "interval": Event is applied at pre-specified intervals of time.

    However, you can also define your own modes and use them in the training process as you see fit.
    For this you will need to add the triggering of that mode in the environment implementation as well.

    .. note::

        The triggering of operations corresponding to the mode ``"interval"`` are the only mode that are
        directly handled by the manager itself. The other modes are handled by the environment implementation.
