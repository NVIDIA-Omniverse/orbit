    """Manager for computing done signals for a given world.

    The termination manager computes the termination signal (also called dones) as a combination
    of termination terms. Each termination term is a function which takes the environment as an
    argument and returns a boolean tensor of shape (num_envs,). The termination manager
    computes the termination signal as the union (logical or) of all the termination terms.

    Following the `Gymnasium API <https://gymnasium.farama.org/tutorials/gymnasium_basics/handling_time_limits/>`_,
    the termination signal is computed as the logical OR of the following signals:

    * **Time-out**: This signal is set to true if the environment has ended after an externally defined condition
      (that is outside the scope of a MDP). For example, the environment may be terminated if the episode has
      timed out (i.e. reached max episode length).
    * **Terminated**: This signal is set to true if the environment has reached a terminal state defined by the
      environment. This state may correspond to task success, task failure, robot falling, etc.

    These signals can be individually accessed using the :attr:`time_outs` and :attr:`terminated` properties.

    The termination terms are parsed from a config class containing the manager's settings and each term's
    parameters. Each termination term should instantiate the :class:`TerminationTermCfg` class. The term's
    configuration :attr:`TerminationTermCfg.time_out` decides whether the term is a timeout or a termination term.
