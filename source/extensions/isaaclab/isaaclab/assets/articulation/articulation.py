class Articulation(RigidObject):
    """An articulation asset class.

    An articulation is a collection of rigid bodies connected by joints. The joints can be either
    fixed or actuated. The joints can be of different types, such as revolute, prismatic, D-6, etc.
    However, the articulation class has currently been tested with revolute and prismatic joints.
    The class supports both floating-base and fixed-base articulations. The type of articulation
    is determined based on the root joint of the articulation. If the root joint is fixed, then
    the articulation is considered a fixed-base system. Otherwise, it is considered a floating-base
    system. This can be checked using the :attr:`Articulation.is_fixed_base` attribute.

    For an asset to be considered an articulation, the root prim of the asset must have the
    `USD ArticulationRootAPI`_. This API is used to define the sub-tree of the articulation using
    the reduced coordinate formulation. On playing the simulation, the physics engine parses the
    articulation root prim and creates the corresponding articulation in the physics engine. The
    articulation root prim can be specified using the :attr:`AssetBaseCfg.prim_path` attribute.

    The articulation class is a subclass of the :class:`RigidObject` class. Therefore, it inherits
    all the functionality of the rigid object class. In case of an articulation, the :attr:`root_physx_view`
    attribute corresponds to the articulation root view and can be used to access the articulation
    related data.

    The articulation class also provides the functionality to augment the simulation of an articulated
    system with custom actuator models. These models can either be explicit or implicit, as detailed in
    the :mod:`isaaclab.actuators` module. The actuator models are specified using the
    :attr:`ArticulationCfg.actuators` attribute. These are then parsed and used to initialize the
    corresponding actuator models, when the simulation is played.

    During the simulation step, the articulation class first applies the actuator models to compute
    the joint commands based on the user-specified targets. These joint commands are then applied
    into the simulation. The joint commands can be either position, velocity, or effort commands.
    As an example, the following snippet shows how this can be used for position commands:

    .. code-block:: python

        # an example instance of the articulation class
        my_articulation = Articulation(cfg)

        # set joint position targets
        my_articulation.set_joint_position_target(position)
        # propagate the actuator models and apply the computed commands into the simulation
        my_articulation.write_data_to_sim()

        # step the simulation using the simulation context
        sim_context.step()

        # update the articulation state, where dt is the simulation time step
        my_articulation.update(dt)

    .. _`USD ArticulationRootAPI`: https://openusd.org/dev/api/class_usd_physics_articulation_root_a_p_i.html
