    """Wrapper around `dataclass` functionality to add extra checks and utilities.

    As of Python 3.7, the standard dataclasses have two main issues which makes them non-generic for
    configuration use-cases. These include:

    1. Requiring a type annotation for all its members.
    2. Requiring explicit usage of :meth:`field(default_factory=...)` to reinitialize mutable variables.

    This function provides a decorator that wraps around Python's `dataclass`_ utility to deal with
    the above two issues. It also provides additional helper functions for dictionary <-> class
    conversion and easily copying class instances.

    Usage:

    .. code-block:: python

        from dataclasses import MISSING

        from isaaclab.utils.configclass import configclass


        @configclass
        class ViewerCfg:
            eye: list = [7.5, 7.5, 7.5]  # field missing on purpose
            lookat: list = field(default_factory=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0])


        @configclass
        class EnvCfg:
            num_envs: int = MISSING
            episode_length: int = 2000
            viewer: ViewerCfg = ViewerCfg()

        # create configuration instance
        env_cfg = EnvCfg(num_envs=24)

        # print information as a dictionary
        print(env_cfg.to_dict())

        # create a copy of the configuration
        env_cfg_copy = env_cfg.copy()

        # replace arbitrary fields using keyword arguments
        env_cfg_copy = env_cfg_copy.replace(num_envs=32)

    Args:
        cls: The class to wrap around.
        **kwargs: Additional arguments to pass to :func:`dataclass`.

    Returns:
        The wrapped class.
