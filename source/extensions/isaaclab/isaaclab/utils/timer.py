    A class to keep track of time for performance measurement.
    It allows timing via context managers and decorators as well.

    It uses the `time.perf_counter` function to measure time. This function
    returns the number of seconds since the epoch as a float. It has the
    highest resolution available on the system.

    As a regular object:

    .. code-block:: python

        import time

        from isaaclab.utils.timer import Timer

        timer = Timer()
        timer.start()
        time.sleep(1)
        print(1 <= timer.time_elapsed <= 2)  # Output: True

        time.sleep(1)
        timer.stop()
        print(2 <= stopwatch.total_run_time)  # Output: True

    As a context manager:

    .. code-block:: python

        import time

        from isaaclab.utils.timer import Timer

        with Timer() as timer:
            time.sleep(1)
