class DelayBuffer:
    """Delay buffer that allows retrieving stored data with delays.

    This class uses a batched circular buffer to store input data. Different to a standard circular buffer,
    which uses the LIFO (last-in-first-out) principle to retrieve the data, the delay buffer class allows
    retrieving data based on the lag set by the user. For instance, if the delay set inside the buffer
    is 1, then the second last entry from the stream is retrieved. If it is 2, then the third last entry
    and so on.

    The class supports storing a batched tensor data. This means that the shape of the appended data
    is expected to be (batch_size, ...), where the first dimension is the batch dimension. Correspondingly,
    the delay can be set separately for each batch index. If the requested delay is larger than the current
    length of the underlying buffer, the most recent entry is returned.

    .. note::
        By default, the delay buffer has no delay, meaning that the data is returned as is.
