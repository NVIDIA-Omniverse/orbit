class CircularBuffer:
    """Circular buffer for storing a history of batched tensor data.

    This class implements a circular buffer for storing a history of batched tensor data. The buffer is
    initialized with a maximum length and a batch size. The data is stored in a circular fashion, and the
    data can be retrieved in a LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) fashion. The buffer is designed to be used in
    multi-environment settings, where each environment has its own data.

    The shape of the appended data is expected to be (batch_size, ...), where the first dimension is the
    batch dimension. Correspondingly, the shape of the ring buffer is (max_len, batch_size, ...).
