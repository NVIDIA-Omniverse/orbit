"""
This test has a lot of duplication with ``test_build_simulation_context_nonheadless.py``. This is intentional to ensure that the
tests are run in both headless and non-headless modes, and we currently can't re-build the simulation app in a script.

If you need to make a change to this test, please make sure to also make the same change to ``test_build_simulation_context_nonheadless.py``.
